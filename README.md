# Trading-site
> Made by [Nerya Bigon](https://github.com/neryabigon)

A web app via which you can manage portfolios of stocks.  
Not only will this tool allow you to check real stocks’ actual prices and portfolios’ values, it will also let you buy (okay, “buy”) and sell (okay, “sell”) stocks by querying IEX for stocks’ prices.  

Learnt to develop with flask, including the use of API (for the stocks info and prices)
